## Architecture

[Describe your product's technical architecture and how components work together]

This template supports applications built with Python Microsoft Semantic Kernel framework and TypeScript frontends. The architecture enables multi-agent AI systems where specialized agents collaborate to deliver comprehensive functionality.

**Template Architecture Includes:**
- **Backend Framework**: Python with Semantic Kernel for AI agent orchestration
- **Frontend Framework**: TypeScript for user interface development
- **AI Integration**: Support for Azure OpenAI and other LLM providers
- **Plugin System**: Extensible plugin architecture for specialized functionality
- **Agent Communication**: Dynamic routing and coordination between AI agents

## Agent Definitions

[Define your AI agents and their specific roles and responsibilities]

**Template Agent Examples:**

1. **[Primary Agent Name] (Orchestrator Agent)**
   - [Primary responsibility and role]
   - [Key functions it performs]
   - [How it coordinates with other agents]
   - [User interaction responsibilities]

2. **[Secondary Agent Name]**
   - [Specific domain expertise]
   - [Key responsibilities]
   - [Data it manages or processes]
   - [Integration points with other agents]

3. **[Additional Agent Name]**
   - [Specialized function]
   - [Input/output responsibilities]
   - [Performance criteria]
   - [Dependencies on other components]

[Add more agents as needed for your specific use case]

## Communication Flow

[Describe how agents communicate and coordinate with each other]

**Example Communication Pattern:**
```
User Input → [Primary Agent] → Routes to appropriate agent(s)
                    ↓
[Agent A] ↔ [Agent B] ↔ [Agent C] ↔ [Agent D]
                    ↓
                [Primary Agent] → User Output
```
